# bib2x

A fork of [bib2x](http://www.xandi.eu/bib2x) by Alexander Feder.

The codebase is almost identical to the original, with some very minor (non-functional) changes 
to compile on modern platforms.

## Building

Building should only require a compatible shell and a C++ compiler. 

In the source directory, execute

```bash
./configure
make
```

You should find the built binary at `src/bib2x`.
